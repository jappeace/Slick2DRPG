# Pokemon sprites
these are all the pokemon sprites, ripped from [bublapedia](
http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Bulbasaur_(Pok%C3%A9mon)
)

the script that did the ripping can be found under
`src/main/python/*`
The excact file will probably change,
but I don't intend on making many python scripts.

## order scheme
the sprites are put into the folder with the name of the proper pokemon.
there is no clever reason for this except it makes sprites grouped better.
My initial idea was to put all sprites based on big small back front
folders and then the pokemon name as image.
But I think this is a anoying division, better too group all data of a specific
pokemon in the same folder

### image explenation
the back and front images are used in battle
the small image is used to show the pokemon in menus

the big one is used when the pokemon is selected
