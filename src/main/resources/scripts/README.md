 
 this folder contains all scripts.
 The top layer should contain scripts that involve all game mechenics.
 here you can also put folders for state specific scripts like the overworld.

 If you like to move scripts around don't forget to update the R class.
 I considerd making a script out of this class but that would just be overkill (and a lot harder)
