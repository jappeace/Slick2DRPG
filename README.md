# Slick2DRPG

This is a cheap pokemon knockoff, made because as a child I had many
frustrations with the original game. For example:

* Why can I only have 4 moves for each pokemon
* Why does every action get precided by a very slow moving text (fixed later by emulators)
* Why can I only carry 6 pokemon (probably because the gameboy had to little ram)
* The battles are kindof repetative
* To much is decided on level alone

## TODO
First I will try to emulate the orignal pokemongame. I'll create a working (stable) prototype
as soon as possible.

* Make the overworld work (ie can go into buildings, talk easily to npcs)
* Replace fuzzy logic with RNG, this makes it easier to add moves, besides the AI, in the orignial pokemon was also retarded
* Implement a proper MVC pattern, these kind of games are made for that, besides the current 'entities (which are models I supose)' can now draw anything they want
* Replace python with groovy (better integration, while the scripting is very similiar)
