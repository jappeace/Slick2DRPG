# Slick2DRPG

This is a cheap pokemon knockoff, made because as a child I had many
frustrations with the original game. For example:

* Why can I only have 4 moves for each pokemon
* Why does every action get precided by a very slow moving text (fixed later by emulators)
* Why can I only carry 6 pokemon (probably because the gameboy had to little ram)
* The battles are kindof repetative
* To much is decided on level alone

## TODO
First I will try to emulate the orignal pokemongame. I'll create a working (stable) prototype
as soon as possible.
